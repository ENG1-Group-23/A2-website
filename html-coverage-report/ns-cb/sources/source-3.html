&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * A Sound is a short audio clip that can be played numerous times in parallel. It&#39;s completely loaded into memory so only load
&nbsp; * small audio files. Call the {@link #dispose()} method when you&#39;re done using the Sound.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Sound instances are created via a call to {@link Audio#newSound(FileHandle)}.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Calling the {@link #play()} or {@link #play(float)} method will return a long which is an id to that instance of the sound. You
&nbsp; * can use this id to modify the playback of that sound instance.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: any values provided will not be clamped, it is the developer&#39;s responsibility to do so
