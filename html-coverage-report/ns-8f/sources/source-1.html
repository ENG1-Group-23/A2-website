&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Register an instance of this class with {@link RunNotifier} to be notified
&nbsp; * of events that occur during a test run. All of the methods in this class
&nbsp; * are abstract and have no implementation; override one or more methods to
&nbsp; * receive events.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * For example, suppose you have a &lt;code&gt;Cowbell&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp; * class that you want to make a noise whenever a test fails. You could write:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * public class RingingListener extends RunListener {
&nbsp; *    public void testFailure(Failure failure) {
&nbsp; *       Cowbell.ring();
&nbsp; *    }
&nbsp; * }
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * To invoke your listener, you need to run your tests through &lt;code&gt;JUnitCore&lt;/code&gt;.
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * public void main(String... args) {
&nbsp; *    JUnitCore core= new JUnitCore();
&nbsp; *    core.addListener(new RingingListener());
&nbsp; *    core.run(MyTestClass.class);
&nbsp; * }
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If a listener throws an exception for a test event, the other listeners will
&nbsp; * have their {@link RunListener#testFailure(Failure)} called with a {@code Description}
&nbsp; * of {@link Description#TEST_MECHANISM} to indicate the failure.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * By default, JUnit will synchronize calls to your listener. If your listener
&nbsp; * is thread-safe and you want to allow JUnit to call your listener from
&nbsp; * multiple threads when tests are run in parallel, you can annotate your
&nbsp; * test class with {@link RunListener.ThreadSafe}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Listener methods will be called from the same thread as is running
&nbsp; * the test, unless otherwise indicated by the method Javadoc
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see org.junit.runner.JUnitCore
&nbsp; * @since 4.0
